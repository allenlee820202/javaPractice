## Task Placement
This program demos the task placement method by serializing a class object (MyClass.java) and send to a remote server. Remote server then deserialize the class object and dynamically creates an object using such class by reflection mechanism.

## Run server first
`java SocketServer`

## Then run client
`java SocketClient`
